\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Project Overview}
The AI-Powered Resume Analyzer is a modern web application designed to provide comprehensive analysis of resumes using artificial intelligence techniques. The system evaluates resume quality, provides ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility scores, identifies skill gaps, and offers personalized career recommendations through an intuitive user interface.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Manual resume screening is a time-consuming process for HR professionals and recruiters. Job seekers often struggle to optimize their resumes for ATS systems and lack insights into how their qualifications align with industry standards. This project addresses these challenges by automating resume analysis and providing actionable feedback.

\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop a user-friendly web interface for resume upload and analysis
    \item Implement automated resume parsing and content extraction
    \item Provide comprehensive scoring mechanisms for resume quality assessment
    \item Generate personalized recommendations for skill development and career advancement
    \item Ensure responsive design for accessibility across all devices
    \item Create interactive data visualizations for better user understanding
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope and Limitations}
The project focuses on frontend development with simulated AI analysis. Real-world implementation would require integration with machine learning models for actual resume parsing and analysis. The current scope includes file upload validation, mock data processing, and comprehensive result presentation.

\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Resume Analysis Technologies}
Modern resume analysis systems utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to extract meaningful information from unstructured text. Key technologies include:

\subsubsection{Text Extraction and Parsing}
Resume parsing involves extracting structured information from various file formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX). Libraries such as pdf-parse for JavaScript and PyPDF2 for Python are commonly used for text extraction.

\subsubsection{Natural Language Processing}
NLP techniques are employed to identify key sections, extract entities (names, skills, companies), and understand context. Modern approaches use transformer-based models like BERT for better semantic understanding.

\subsubsection{ATS Compatibility Analysis}
Applicant Tracking Systems use keyword matching and formatting analysis to rank resumes. Research shows that proper keyword optimization can increase resume visibility by up to 70\%.

\subsection{Web Development Technologies}
The project leverages modern web development frameworks and libraries:

\subsubsection{React and TypeScript}
React provides component-based architecture for maintainable user interfaces, while TypeScript adds static type checking for improved code quality and developer experience.

\subsubsection{Data Visualization}
Interactive charts and graphs are implemented using Recharts library, providing users with visual insights into their resume analysis results.
